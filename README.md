## Environment

I suggest to use venv:

`python -m venv env_name`

And then install the qt and other stuff

### Activate venv

`source env_name/bin/activate`

After activating, you should see the name of environment before your shell's
prompt:

`(env_name) [user@hostname]$ `

### pyqt5

`pip install pyqt5`
